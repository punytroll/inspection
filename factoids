UCS stands for Universal Character Set.
ISO/IEC 10646 is a standard, defining a set of characters.
Unicode is a standard, defining a set of characters.
UCS-2 is an older character encoding of Unicode codepoints.
UCS-2 is a fixed width character encoding, always using 2 bytes / 16 bits.
UCS-2 (as opposed to UTF-16) cannot encode with surrogate pairs.
ISO/IEC 8859-1:1997 is undefined in the inclusive hexadecimal ranges 0x00-0x1f and 0x7f-0x9f.
ID3v2.3 is contradicting itself when stating that ISO/IEC 8859-1:1997 strings may contain characters in the range 0x20-0xff, because some of those vaules are undefined.
ID3v2.4 is contradicting itself when stating that ISO/IEC 8859-1:1997 strings may contain characters in the range 0x20-0xff, because some of those vaules are undefined.
ID3v2.3 is not sufficiently precise on whether strings, ending on a frame boundary, may be terminated.
ISO/IEC 8859-1 was incorporated as the first 256 code points of ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode.

ASF is vague in the description of field Codec Name Length of Codec Entries in Codec List Objects: it specifies "the number of Unicode characters stored in the Codec Name field". The content of the Codec Name field is a UTF16LE string, which means, that characters might also be 32 bits long with surrogate pairs. Additionally, some Unicode code points are not really characters, but parts of a glyph. To address the latter issue, I will assume, that this actually means the number of code points, although I am pretty sure, that this will fail when we hit the first surrogate pair code point.
