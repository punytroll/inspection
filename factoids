UCS stands for Universal Character Set.
UCS-2 is an older encryption of unicode codepoints.
UCS-2 is a fixed width encoding, always using 2 bytes / 16 bits.
UCS-2 (as opposed to UTF-16) cannot encode with surrogate pairs.
ISO/IEC 8859-1:1997 is undefined in the inclusive hexadecimal ranges 0x00-0x1f and 0x7f-0x9f.
ID3v2.3 is contradicting itself when stating that ISO/IEC 8859-1:1997 strings may contain characters in the range 0x20-0xff, because some of those vaules are undefined.
ID3v2.4 is contradicting itself when stating that ISO/IEC 8859-1:1997 strings may contain characters in the range 0x20-0xff, because some of those vaules are undefined.
ID3v2.3 is not sufficiently precise on whether strings ending on a frame boundary may be terminated.
